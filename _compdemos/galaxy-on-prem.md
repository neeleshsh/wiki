Galaxy is an open, web-based platform for accessible, reproducible, and transparent computational research, particularly for genomics data. 
Other organizations make [Galaxy](https://usegalaxy.org/) available for free use by academic researchers,
but this requires you to transfer your data,
and the computational capacity is limited since it is shared with many other people.
Our current method of supporting Galaxy for the Fred Hutch research community is via our on-premise compute clusters, 
`rhino` and `gizmo`.
Individual researchers have the ability to create, administer, and run their own instances (copies) of the Galaxy platform, 
including choosing and loading all software necessary for their analysis. 

The steps to run Galaxy include:
- create your Galaxy instance
- load your data and software
- 

## Creating your first Galaxy instance

The steps to create a Galaxy instance include:
- logging on to `rhino`
- running the `galaxy` command (takes ~30 minutes to create an instance)
- launching the Galaxy instance through a web interface

While this does require a bit of setup when getting started,
you only need to do this once,
after which you're able to retrieve the same instance and begin working with data more quickly.

Creating and using Galaxy on `gizmo` requires you to first log on to the Fred Hutch on-premise compute cluster `rhino`.
If you aren't familiar with this process, 
please see [this tutorial](/compdemos/first_rhino/).
Note that you will need to keep the shell window connecting you to `rhino` open while the instance is being created.
One way to ensure this connectivity is to use [tmux or NoMachine](/scicomputing/access_methods/)] to ensure a long-running shell.

Once logged on to `rhino`,
run the `galaxy` command as shown below. 
To create your first instance,
type `1` and hit "Enter".
When prompted, type the name and hit "Enter".
This will create a new folder in your `/fast/` drive named `galaxies`, 
then download and install the relevant software in a folder within `galaxies` with the name you indicated.  

```bash
username@rhino03:~ galaxy
Enter number to select your Galaxy install
1) New-Install
#? 1 
New Install: Enter a name for the Galaxy instance: test_galaxy
```

FIXME: need to leave window open? does `galaxy` wrap sbatch?

A few minutes after the installation has been started you should receive an email like this:

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/compdemos/assets/2020-06-17-01-10-04.png)

Now you wait about 30 min. Then you should see the Galaxy login screen. Use your HutchnetID and password to login to the Galaxy interface:

![Login Screen]({{ site.baseurl }}/compdemos/assets/2020-06-17-01-19-43.png)


To terminate the Galaxy instance just type Ctrl+c twice inside the terminal Window. It will cancel the cluster job that runs Galaxy. 

## Rerunning a previously created Galaxy instance

```bash
username@rhino03:~ galaxy
Enter number to select your Galaxy install
1) /fh/fast/_HDC/user/username/galaxies/demo/
2) New-Install
#? 1
```

## Loading data into Galaxy

### Data from Fred Hutch storage

### Reference data

## Suggestions for making the most of Galaxy

Please check the [Galaxy Documentation](https://docs.galaxyproject.org/) for more general information about using Galaxy. 

### Reproducible workflows

### Sharing your Galaxy instance with Hutch collaborators

### Transferring analyses outside Galaxy

## Troubleshooting

### Proxy error

If you click on the link before your Galaxy instance has finished installing you will see a proxy error: 

![Proxy Error]({{ site.baseurl }}/compdemos/assets/2020-06-17-01-12-09.png)


Try again after a while. Then you should see the Galaxy login screen. 

### Wrong session token

When using Chrome, you might see this error message:

"Wrong session Token found."

## Why this method of supporting Galaxy?

In the past,
fredhutch.io supported a Galaxy instance for our research community, 
and we tested using an external company, Globus Genomics,
to support Galaxy.

free use by academic researchers,
but this requires you to transfer your data,
and the computational capacity is limited since it is shared with many other people.

- HutchNet ID authentication will be used 
- The instance will run with the launching user's permissions, these will be used for all data library access (e.g. file system)
- User maintains their own workflows (and thus can migratee them to newer installation of Galaxy if/when needed)
- User can self install the software as well as restart existing Galaxy servers, or make new ones if needed
- A simple database is provided (sqlite instead of Postgres)
- Each user can have access to multiple Galaxy instances (e.g. in case software updates need to be implemented)
- Galaxy server will run on a `gizmo` node, thus compute capacity is limited to single node (36 cores)
